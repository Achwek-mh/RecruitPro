<!-- Description of Template -->
<p>
During my internship, I took on the responsibility of developing a comprehensive recruitment management platform for the company. This platform was designed to streamline and oversee the entire recruitment process, catering to both internships and full-time employment opportunities. By creating this platform, I facilitated efficient coordination and management of recruitment-related activities within the organization.
